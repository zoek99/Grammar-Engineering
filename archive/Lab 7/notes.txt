1. How do define Adjectives, Adverbs, and other parts of speech which don't belong in noun/verb inflection PCs, but rather are stand alone words?
2. How do define focus and other topic markers? Focus marker oft used with question words.
3. How to fix our analysis of genitive possession? (re: Lab 5 comments)

Focus marker (re) + questions

human   FOC     smell   smell.3s    where   FOC     what    FOC?"

After the eagle arrived, the eagle [said] "Where is the human smell coming from today, where and what?"

Need to add 
- Adjectives
- Adverbs
- Prepostions
[then add non-verbal predicate constructions]


Approach
1. Add copula -> lexicon, morphology
2. Add adjectives -> lexicon, morphology
3. Test AdjP phrases via LKBTop

Repeat 2-3 for adpositions, locative NP 


(Equative predication, page 185)

===============================================================================
1. Follow-up on canvas questions
2. Add items to test suite
- Copula + NP
go  dzɔŋgɔli        bu-ŋu
1s  N.forest-man    be-1s
I am a forest man
- Copula + A P

3. Dolapo to decribe how non verbal predicates work including IGT
4. Zoe to describe tdl changes
