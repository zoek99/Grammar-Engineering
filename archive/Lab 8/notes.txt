1. We stopped chaining verb pcs and instead added lexical rules
2. We redefined our case system to account for NOM-ERG split in agent roles

Todo:
1. Add the rest of the verb endings
2. Audit our test suite's grammaticality judgments

3. Office hours thursday: ask how to evaluate MMT output and harmonize MRSes


MMT translation explosion is because of locative affixes licensed by the locative-pp-phrase combined with a prodrop language -> they are S -> PP VP 

dogs chase cars
eng -> tdh does not generate but gives no error
thd -> eng gives error because of predicate..but this is unexpected because the monotransitive has the expected predicate "_chase_v_rel" and the intransitive has "chase_or_pursue". If it used the monotransitive (as expected) it would work.
