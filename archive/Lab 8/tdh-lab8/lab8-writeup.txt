Description of simple transitive and intransitive clauses in Thulung
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thulung has intransitive, mono-transitive, and di-transitive verbs. For this
week, we focus on intransitive and mono-transitive verbs, since the lexicon does
 not yet cover di-transitive verbs.
The intransitive verbs have nominative zero-marking on the subject, and the
verb ending encodes both pernum feature of the subject and tense:
go ʌms-ŋu
1SG.pron sleep-1SG.npst
'I sleep'

khlea-mim ʌms-mi
dog-pl sleep-3pl.npst
'Dogs sleep'

The mono-transitive-verbs have four alignment patterns found with
mono-transitive scenarios, based on the nature of the agent and patient:
-A: nominative-marked (unmarked) for 1st person and 2nd person singular and
dual; ergative-marked for 2nd plural, 3rd person and other NP's;
-P: nominative-marked (unmarked) for in-animates; dative-marked for
high-status humans. Non-human animates and low-status animates are optionally
marked.
The verb ending encodes pernum features of agent and patient, as well as the
tense:
go khlea(-lai) khlo-u
1sg dog(-dat) trap-1sg.3sg.npst
'I trap the dog.'

gu-ka khlea(-lai) khlo-ʉ
3sg-erg dog(-dat) trap-3sg.3sg.npst
'He traps the dog.'

go mytsy-lai khlo-u
1sg person trap-1sg.3sg.npst
'I trap the person.'

gu-ka mytsy-lai khlo-ʉ
3sg-erg mytsy-dat trap-3sg.3sg.npst
'He traps the person.'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation of simple transitive and intransitive clauses in Thulung
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before this lab, our verb ending rules are chained, and each of the position
classes has a zero-marker lrt so that the pc is obligatory. However, this has
resulted in huge ambiguity - we can see around 1000 rules leading to a VP.
This week, we completely restructure our verb ending system. We got rid of the
chained rules and replaced them with one single tense-role-position class. This
position class has around 180 lrts, each assigning lexical rule instance(s) to a
 configuration of tense, subject, and object if the verb is transitive.

The following snippet fron irules.tdl shows part of the implementation.
        Intransitive-Nonpast-2DU-suffix1 :=
        %suffix (* -tsi)
        Intransitive-Nonpast-2DU-lex-rule.

        Intransitive-Nonpast-2DU-suffix2 :=
        %suffix (* -ʦi)
        Intransitive-Nonpast-2DU-lex-rule.
        ...
        Transitive-Nonpast-2duAgent-1sgPatient-suffix1 :=
        %suffix (* -ŋitsi)
        Transitive-Nonpast-2duAgent-1sgPatient-lex-rule.

        Transitive-Nonpast-2duAgent-1sgPatient-suffix2 :=
        %suffix (* -ŋiʦi)
        Transitive-Nonpast-2duAgent-1sgPatient-lex-rule.
        ...
        Intransitive-Past-1pe-suffix1 :=
        %suffix (* -toko)
        Intransitive-Past-1pe-lex-rule.

        Intransitive-Past-1pe-suffix2 :=
        %suffix (* -ttoko)
        Intransitive-Past-1pe-lex-rule.
        ...
        Transitive-Past-1sgAgent-3plPatient-suffix1 :=
        %suffix (* -tomi)
        Transitive-Past-1sgAgent-3plPatient-lex-rule.

        Transitive-Past-1sgAgent-3plPatient-suffix2 :=
        %suffix (* -utomi)
        Transitive-Past-1sgAgent-3plPatient-lex-rule.

The following snippet from thulung.tdl shows part of the implementation:
        Transitive-Nonpast-3plAgent-3plPatient-lex-rule := TENSE+ROLE-position-class-lex
        -rule-super & infl-lex-rule &
          [ DTR.INFLECTED.TRANSITIVE-VERB-FLAG +,
            SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE nonpast,
                           CAT.VAL [ SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3pl,
                                     COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3pl ] ] ].

        Intransitive-Past-1sg-lex-rule := TENSE+ROLE-position-class-lex-rule-super & infl-lex-rule &
          [ DTR.INFLECTED.COPULA-NP-PRED-PST-VERB-OR-INTRANSITIVE-VERB-FLAG +,
            SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE past,
                           CAT.VAL.SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 1sg ] ].

In thulung.tdl, we removed NOM-intransitive-verb-lex and
ERG-DAT-transitive-verb-lex and copied over their constraints to their sole
daughters: in-transitive-verb-lex and mono-transitive-verb-lex. We are not sure
 if the case constraints in ARG-ST and in SYNSEM are redundant, so we decided
 it is safer to keep them both:
        mono-transitive-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
          [ ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
                                      [ CASE NOM+ERG ] ],
                     [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
                                      [ CASE DAT ] ] >,
            SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL [ SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE NOM+ERG,
                                   COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE DAT ] ].

        in-transitive-verb-lex := intransitive-verb-lex &
          [ ARG-ST.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
                                        [ CASE NOM ],
            SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE NOM,
            INFLECTED [ IN-TRANSITIVE-VERB-FLAG +,
                        IN-TRANSITIVE-VERB-OR-MONO-TRANSITIVE-VERB-FLAG + ] ].

We also redefined our case system to account for the nom/erg marking for agent
in mono-transitive verb construction. We defined NOM and ERG as subtypes under
the same parent type NOM+ERG:
        case := *top*.
        real-case := case.  ; intermediate case type for tripartite cases
        ABL := case.  ; Ablative
        COM := case.  ; Comitative
        GEN := case.  ; Genitive
        hiL := case.  ; high locative
        lev := case.  ; level locative
        LOC := case.  ; locative
        loL := case.  ; low locative
        DAT := real-case.  ; Dative
        ERG+INS := real-case.
        NOM+ERG := real-case.
        ERG := ERG+INS & NOM+ERG. ; Ergative
        INS := ERG+INS. ; Instrumental
        NOM := NOM+ERG. ; Nominative

The mono-transitive-verb-lex reflects this change in the case constraints on the
 agent:
         mono-transitive-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
          [ ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
                                      [ CASE NOM+ERG ] ],
                     [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
                                      [ CASE DAT ] ] >,
            SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL [ SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE NOM+ERG,
                                   COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE DAT ] ].

With this implementation, both nominative and ergative cases can be the case of
an agent in transitive sentence. We realize that this can result in the grammar
licensing ungrammatical sentences where third person agents are unmarked. If
we have more time, we want to work on the pernum system to trim down this
over-generation. We have a question on how to insert the subtype 2pl+3rd (second
 person plural and all thirs person) within the following pernum structure. The
 dilemma we face is the 3rd is defined under 3rd+pl:
        pernum := *top*.
        du := pernum.
        2nd := pernum.
        1du := 1st & du.
        1du_incl := 1du.
        1du_excl := 1du.
        2du := 2nd & du & 2du+2sg+3sg+2pl.
        3du := du & 3du+3sg.
        1pl := 1st & pl.
        1pl_incl := 1pl.
        1pl_excl := 1pl.
        2pl := 2nd & pl & 2du+2sg+3sg+2pl.
        3pl := 3rd & pl.
        1sg := 1st & sg.
        2sg := 2nd & sg & plain+2sg & polite+2sg & 2du+2sg+3sg+2pl.
        3sg := sg & plain+3sg & polite+3sg & 3du+3sg & 2du+2sg+3sg+2pl.
        1polite := 1st & polite.
        2polite := 2nd & polite & pl+2polite.
        3polite := 3rd & polite & pl+3polite.
        1plain := 1st & plain.
        2plain := 2nd & plain.
        3plain := 3rd & plain.
        plain+2sg := pernum.
        plain := plain+2sg & plain+3sg.
        polite+2sg := pernum.
        polite := polite+2sg & polite+3sg.
        plain+3sg := pernum.
        1st+sg := pernum.
        1st := 1st+sg.
        sg := 1st+sg.
        polite+3sg := pernum.
        3rd+pl := pernum.
        3rd := 3rd+pl.
        pl+2polite := pernum.
        pl := pl+2polite & pl+3polite.
        pl+3polite := 3rd+pl.
        3du+3sg := 3rd & 3du+3sg+2du+2sg+2pl.
        3du+3sg+2du+2sg+2pl := pernum.
        2du+2sg+3sg+2pl := 3du+3sg+2du+2sg+2pl.

As for nom-dat marking on patient, our current implementation does not allow
zero-marking on patient, since our lexicon does not yet have animacy as a feature.

Some examples of our current implementation are as follows:
1. intransitive verbs
        Judgment: g
        go ʌms-ŋu
        1SG.pron sleep-1SG.npst
        'I sleep'

        Judgment: g
        khlea-mim ʌms-mi
        dog-pl sleep-3pl.npst
        'Dogs sleep'
These two sentences parse, because the pernum feature on verb agrees with that
on the subject.

2. mono-transitive verbs
        Judgment: g
        go khlea-lai khlo-u
        1sg dog-dat trap-1sg.3sg.npst
        'I trap the dog.'

        Judgment: g
        gu-ka khlea-lai khlo-ʉ
        3sg-erg dog-dat trap-3sg.3sg.npst
        'He traps the dog.'

        Judgment: g
        go mytsy-lai khlo-to
        1sg person trap-1sg.3sg.pst
        'I trapped the person.'

        Judgment: g
        gu-ka mytsy-lai khlo-ɖʉ
        3sg-erg mytsy-dat trap-3sg.3sg.pst
        'He trapped the person.'
These four sentences parse, because they have PERNUM agreement between
agent/patient and verb ending. We are not sure why there are two parses for the
last sentence. The trees show that the verb ending has two corresponding lexical
 rule, but this is what we see from the irules.tdl:
         Transitive-Past-3sgAgent-3sgPatient-suffix1 :=
        %suffix (* -ɖʉ)
        Transitive-Past-3sgAgent-3sgPatient-lex-rule.

        Transitive-Past-3sgAgent-3sgPatient-suffix2 :=
        %suffix (* -ʉɖʉ)
        Transitive-Past-3sgAgent-3sgPatient-lex-rule.

Overgeneration:
        Judgment: g
        go-ka mytsy-lai khlo-to
        1sg-erg person trap-1sg.3sg.pst
        'I trapped the person.'
This sentence does parse, even though 1sg should be underspecified for ergative.
We think we need to work on refining ther pernum system to tackle this.

        Judgment: g
        gu-ka ganimim-lai si-be-ni
        3sg-erg 2pron.pl.-dat die-cau-3sg.pst
        'He ordered you to die.'
This is example of an intransitive lexicon goes through valence changes with the
 causative marker and uses transitive verb ending.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MMT generation clean up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To improve on our MMT, we focused on (1) simple transitive and intransitive clauses and (2) non-verbal predicates. We are able to get generation working from tdh -> eng but not the other way around. We know this requires transfer rules. To get the tdh -> eng generation, we didn't have to do much. However, we did run into a small but easily overlooked problem. We initially had sentence 16 working last week, but this week it stopped working! We realized this was because we changed the predicate value of /bloku/ from 'river' to 'park' in lexicon.tdl, but we did not change it in our choices file. 

    bloku := COMMON-NOUNS-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "bloku" >,
          SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_park_n_rel" ].
    ; the above should be "river" but changed to park for MMT

When we changed our implementation of verb tenses this week, we used the matrix customization system. As such, generating a new grammar via the website overwrote the changes in our lexicon.tdl because the choices file had a different predicate. We learned our lesson! We are getting a significant amount of realized-string ambiguity. There are two reasons.

The first source of ambiguity is the interaction of the locative-pp-phrase and pro-drop in Thulung. When generating, we see our locatives affixes (5 variations) attaching to an NP. This NP is then treated as a PP which attaches to the VP. Since Thulung is a pro-drop language, S -> PP VP is licensing these sentences. We could constrain this by adding a constraint to PP VP that they must be used with an overt subject by setting the OPT value to [-]. We were focused on fixing our tense implementation so we did not get to add this constraint yet but we will!

The second source of ambiguity is that we have aspect and mood markers. While we have the aspect, mood, tense, and negation markers attaching in the correct order, we have not constrained what the interaction of [verb, aspect, tense, mood] looks like semantically. We are essentially, overgeneralizing. Right now, verb -> aspect -> tense -> mood is licensed for every type of verb, aspect, tense, mood. Some constructions are disallowed.

For example, to make the perfect, a past-tense verb is nominalized then followed by the copula. We have no constraints to prevent this from happening with a non-past verb. 

bante       lɔm-ri-m            bu-mi
where       go-3p-NOM           be-3p
Where did they go?

This is a contrived example as we don't currently have the perfect working but it serves to illustrate how tense, aspect, mood have additional constraints we have not put in place. This allows the MMT to spawn every possible combination.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MMT generation attempt and status of sentences (1) and (2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sentence #1
eng: Dogs sleep
sje: Bednaga urri
tdh: khlea-mim ʌms-mi

First we loaded each language's grammar in LKB (mmt/grammars/iso) and confirmed each sentence parsed. Then we looked at the semantics via simple MRS.

Across all 3 languages, the index [e] has SF value prop-or-ques. sje does not have mood or aspect, so there is no mood or aspect value. In sje and eng, #1 is present tense, but in tdh it is non-past. This meant that we had to work on our semi.vpm so that non-past in thulung was recognized as present in english. Additionally, english and thulung both have aspect, however in english the aspect value is "aspect" whereas it is "no-aspect".

In our semi.vpm, we have non-past in tdh mapping to present or future. We are unsure how to fix this as we don't want non-past to map to only present, though it would simplify things for the sake of this exercise.

                E.TENSE : TENSE
                    nonpast << present
                    nonpast << future
                    nonpast <> nonpast
                    past <> past
                    * <> *

Additionally, we want to have [e] go to [no-aspect] in Thulung because unless there is an overt expressed aspect, then it means there was no-aspect. It seems like a disagreement in the fundamentals of the languages and we are unsure how to proceed.
                E.ASPECT : ASPECT
                * >> no-aspect
                no-aspect << [e]

Lastly, the order of the items on the RELS list is the same in sje and eng, but differs for tdh. We don't know if this is having a material effect on our lack of generation but it seems plausible since we can translate from eng to sje but from neither to tdh. Though, we can translate from tdh to both languages so perhaps not?

eng-RELS: <_dog_n_rel, exist_q_rel, _sleep_v_rel>
sje-RELS: <_dog_n_rel, exist_q_rel, _sleep_v_rel>
tdh-RELS: <exist_q_rel, _dog_n_rel, _sleep_v_rel>

All three languages have qeq in the HCONS. The semantics are the same in all languages. ARGO of exist_q_rel is ARG1 of _sleep_v_rel which is the _dog_n_rel.
ARG0 if _sleep_v_rel is [e], the index.

Sentence #2
eng: Dogs chase cars
sje: Bednaga haoskaoli bijlajd
tdh: khlea-mim thuri-mim-lai khaʈ-mi

We follow the same process for sentence 2. The tense, aspect, and mood analysis is the same. Similarly, though the semantics are the same across all three languages, the order of items on the RELS list is consistent between eng and sje but differs with tdh. There are two qeq items on the HCONS for all three languages. 

eng-RELS: <_dog_n_rel, exist_q_rel, _chase_v_rel, _car_n_rel, exist_q_rel>
sje-RELS: <_dog_n_rel, exist_q_rel, _chase_v_rel, _car_n_rel, exist_q_rel>
tdh-RELS: <exist_q_rel, _dog_n_rel, exist_q_rel, _car_n_rel, _chase_v_rel>

The ARG0 of the first exist_q_rel is the ARG0 of _dog_n_rel [x4]. The ARG0 of the second exist_q_rel is the ARG0 of _car_n_rel [x9]. The ARG0 of _chase_v_rel is the index [e]. The ARG1 of _chase_v_rel is [x4]. The ARG1 is [x9]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We definitely saw marked improvement using our new implementation of tense! We are going back and auditing all of oru test sentences to make sure our judgments hold. Some judgments have changed, for example #2 is no longer grammatical because in our new implementation, we are not currently analyzing the overt past tense morpheme. Unlike the tense+role portmanteauxed morpheme, this morpheme appears before aspect. This week's results are exciting!

One sentence that is giving us a surprising bit of difficulty is 

khlosi-thaɖ-ɖa
return-itf-3sg.pst
'He returned all of a sudden.'

Thulung is pro-drop so this should be grammatical. However, we cannot figure out why this is not parsing!
