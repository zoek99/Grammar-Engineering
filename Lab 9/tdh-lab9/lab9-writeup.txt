Description of MRS refinement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Lab 8, we worked on harmonizing our MRSes for sentences that were possible in
Thulung. As such, we didn't need to make predicate related changes in Lab 9 to harmonize the MRSes. The changes we needed to make were related to the semi.vpm.

We added 

(1) no-mood: mood in our thulung.tdl file
Then we changed our mood section in semi.vpm, keeping only irrealis mood, which
is the mood we worked on for the past tense negation.
This resulted in our semi.vpm section going from 
    E.MOOD : E.MOOD
    IRR <> IRR
    IMP <> IMP
    OBL <> OBL
    * <> *
to,
    E.MOOD : MOOD
    IRR <> IRR
    ;  IMP >> *
    ;  OBL >> *
    * >> no-mood
    no-mood << [e]

(2) Trigger rules
Sentences 15-17 weren't working because we didn't have lexical rules for our semantically empty copula. In trigger.mtr we added 
    ;;; non past
    bu_2_gr := arg0e_gtr &
    [ CONTEXT.RELS.LIST < [ PRED "~.*_[a|p]_rel"] >,
        FLAGS.TRIGGER "bu_2" ].

(3) Transfer rules
In acm.mtr we added a transfer rule so that our _loc_p_rel would be translated to _in_p_rel. 
    loc-mtr := in-loc-mtr.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of changes made to constrain overgeneration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Miscellaneous Cleanup:
    ;;;locative-genitivation-suffix :=
    ;;;%suffix (* -ram)
    ;;;locative-genitivation-lex-rule.
    and polysyllabic-general-relativizer-prefix, etc..
We noticed some unconstrained suffixes that we previously implemented in the
noun position classes. Since we do not fully understand the construction of
genitization and relitivization processes, we commented them out so that they
will not freely attach to nouns.
Before we made the change, we see overflowing generations like this:
    khlea-mim-ka-ram ʌms-mi
    dog-pl-erg-?     sleep-3pl.npst
    Dogs sleep
After this change, we strictly allow the correct case marker to attach to nouns.
Correct generation:
    khlea-mim-ka   ʌms-mi
    dog-pl-erg     sleep-3pl.npst
    Dogs sleep

2. Missing constraints:
For some reason, maybe we forgot to check a box in customization page, we see
some missing constraints, so we added case/pernum value to the lex-rule.
2.1. Add case value to locatives:
    loLOC-case-marker-lex-rule := CASE-POSITION-CLASS-lex-rule-super &
    add-only-no-ccont-rule & infl-lex-rule &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE loL ].
    and hiLoc, levLOC, etc..
Before we made the change, we see some generations with the following wrong
construction.
    khlea-mim-ka-ju    ʌms-mi
    dog-pl-erg-loL     sleep-3pl.npst
    Dogs sleep
After this change, we strictly allow the correct case marker to attach to nouns.
Correct generation:
    khlea-mim-ka    ʌms-mi
    dog-pl-erg      sleep-3pl.npst
    Dogs sleep

2.2. Add PERNUM value:
    1st-person-plural-inclusive-noun-lex := PERSONAL-PRONOUNS-noun-lex &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.PRON +,
                       CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 1pl_incl ] ].
Before we made the change, we see generations where the verb ending has
disagreeing role markers with the agent:
    gui gana-lai khat-ni
    1pl.incl 2sg-dat chase-1sg.2sg.npst
    I(We) chase you.
After this change, we strictly allow the right pernum for agent that agrees with
 the verb ending.
Correct generation:
    go  gana-lai khat-ni
    1sg 2sg-dat  chase-1sg.2sg.npst
    I chase you.

3. Squash realizations in irules:
We squashed the allophones to one line. Some of the rules we squashed:
    LOC-case-marker-suffix :=
    %suffix (* -ɖa) (* -ra) (* -nu)
    1st-Person-Possessive-prefix :=
    %prefix (* a-) (* ama-) (* aki-) (* akima-) (* aʦi-)
Thanks to your suggestion, our generation is so much cleaner now.

4. Make pluralization obligatory:
We realized that our pluralization PCs were not obligatory before, and since
singular form has zero morpheme, we see overgeneration with unspecified PERNUM,
so we added the pluralization FLAG. Some changes are shown below:
    inflected :+ [ ...,
        NOMINAL-PLURALIZATION-FLAG luk ].

    infl-satisfied :+ [ ...,
        NOMINAL-PLURALIZATION-FLAG na-or-+ ].

    COMMON-NOUNS-noun-lex := noun-lex & CASE-POSITION-CLASS-rule-dtr &
    POSSESSIVE-POSITION-CLASS-rule-dtr &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3rd,
        INFLECTED [ NOMINAL-PLURALIZATION-FLAG -,
                    CASE-POSITION-CLASS-FLAG -,
                    POSSESSIVE-POSITION-CLASS-FLAG - ] ].

    nominal-PLURALIZATION-lex-rule-super := CASE-POSITION-CLASS-rule-dtr &
    POSSESSIVE-POSITION-CLASS-rule-dtr & add-only-no-ccont-rule &
      [ INFLECTED [ NOMINAL-PLURALIZATION-FLAG +,
                    ... ],
        DTR COMMON-NOUNS-noun-lex &
            [ INFLECTED [ ... ] ] ].

    make_nominal_plurals-lex-rule := infl-lex-rule & nominal-PLURALIZATION-lex-rule-super &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM pl ].

    make_duals-lex-rule := infl-lex-rule & nominal-PLURALIZATION-lex-rule-super &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM du ].

    make_sg-lex-rule := const-lex-rule & nominal-PLURALIZATION-lex-rule-super &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM sg ].

    make_sg-lex := make_sg-lex-rule. (in lrules)
Before we made the change, we see wrong generation like the following:
    khlea pe-mi
    dog sleep-3pl
    Dog(s) sleep.
After this change, we do not have unspecified pernum on nouns anymore.
Correct generation:
    khlea-mim pe-mi
    dog-pl    sleep-3pl
    Dogs sleep.

5. Add causative valence changing strategy:
Due to our previous work, causative marker is under aspect marker, which is not
an obligatory position class, yet the lex-rule does not have any case/aspect
constraint, so the marker was freely attaching to verbs. So we added the val-chg
 strategy and added the pred value.
    CAU-marker-lex-rule := Aspect-POSITION-CLASS-lex-rule-super &
    causative-to-arg2-itr-op-lex-rule & same-non-local-lex-rule &
      [ C-CONT.RELS.LIST < [ PRED "_CAU_v_rel" ] > ].

    We also defined: causative-to-arg2-itr-op-lex-rule and scopal-rel-lex-rule.
Before this change, we would see:
    khlea-mim-be  pe-mi
    dog-pl-cau    sleep-3pl
    Dogs(?) sleep.
After the change, causative marker cannot attach anymore.

6. Negation:
We found that negation marker could not attach to verbs. We suspect this is a
residue of the chained rule system we had before for verb endings. We then
commented out the line that disallows negation:
    main-verb-lex := verb-lex & basic-verb-lex & basic-non-wh-word-lex &
    GENITIVIZATION-or-NOMINALIZATION-rule-dtr &
    HEARSAY-Marking-Position-Class-rule-dtr &
    MOOD-Position-Class-rule-dtr & NEGATION-position-class-rule-dtr &
      TENSE+ROLE-position-class-rule-dtr & need-to-add-mood-rule-dtr &
      [ INFLECTED [ TENSE+ROLE-POSITION-CLASS-FLAG -
                    ;ADD-NEGATION-TO-VERB-FLAG na-or--
                    ],
        SYNSEM [ ... ],
        ARG-ST.FIRST #subj &
                     [ ... ] ].
Now we can generate this sentence:
    khlea-mim-ka thuri-mim-lai mi-khat-mi
    dog-pl-erg   cat-pl-dat    neg-chase-3pl.3pl.npst
    Dogs do not chase cats.

7. Feature resolution in NP coordination:
We found that the verb ending in a transitive sentence where the agent is a
coordinated NP selects any PERNUM for agent, because NP coordination strategy
always had unspecified PERNUM for the parent. So we added feature resolution
like the following: (we also forced case to agree)
    3pl-3pl-3pl-pernum-coord-rule := coord-phrase &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3pl,
        LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3pl,
        RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3pl ].
    np2-3pl-3pl-3pl-top-coord-rule := basic-np-top-coord-rule &
    apoly-top-coord-rule & 3pl-3pl-3pl-pernum-coord-rule &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.CASE #case,
                       COORD-STRAT "2" ],
        RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE #case,
        LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE #case ].
Before this change, we see wrong verb endings in generation:
    subupo-mim-ka khlea-mim-ka thuri-mim-lai khat-umi
    cat-pl-erg    dog-pl-erg   car-pl-dat    chase-3sg.3pl.npst
    Cats and dogs chases cars.
After this change, we see the correct generation:
    subupo-mim-ka khlea-mim-ka thuri-mim-lai khat-mi
    cat-pl-erg    dog-pl-erg   car-pl-dat    chase-3pl.3pl.npst
    Cats and dogs chase cars.

8. Disallow specifier on locative-pp:
This change is motivated by the previous lab. We want to disallow PP to be the
specifier of the copula, so we made the list empty:
    locative-pp-phrase := unary-phrase &
    [ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL #nl,
               LOCAL.CAT [ ...
                      VAL [ ...,
                            SPEC < >  ]]],
        C-CONT [ ... ],
          ARGS < ... >].

9. Case constraint to cop-lex
We found that our cop-lex does not select any specific case for its subject,
so we added this constraint:
    cop-lex := basic-verb-lex-super & trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-2 &
      [ INFLECTED [ COPULA-NPST-PERNUM-MARKER-FLAG -],
        SYNSEM.LOCAL [ ... ],
        ARG-ST < #subj &
                 [ LOCAL [ ...,
                           CAT [ ...,
                                 HEAD noun &
                                      [ CASE NOM ] ] ] ],
                 ... > ].
Before this change, we saw generations where subject can be any case value:
    khlea-mim-lai bloku-ra bu-mi
    dog-pl-dat    park-loc be-3pl
    Dogs are in the park.
After this change, we strictly allow nominative to be the case of the subject:
    khlea-mim bloku-ra bu-mi
    dog-pl    park-loc be-3pl
    Dogs are in the park.

10. Force inflections on cop-lex and cop-np-pred-lex:
We realized inflections are not obligatory on both types of copula, which
resulted in VPs with underspecified PERNUM value. So we added the inflection
FLAG to both copulas:
    cop-lex := basic-verb-lex-super & trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-2 &
      [ INFLECTED [ COPULA-NPST-PERNUM-MARKER-FLAG -],
        SYNSEM.LOCAL [ ... ],
        ARG-ST < ... > ].
    cop-np-pred-lex := norm-sem-lex-item & verb-lex & transitive-lex-item &
      [ INFLECTED [ COPULA-NPST-PERNUM-MARKER-FLAG -],
        SYNSEM [ ... ],
        ARG-ST < ... > ].
When the tense affixes attach via subtypes of the copula-npst-pernum-marker-lex-rule-super, the inflection is satisfied.


    copula-npst-pernum-marker-lex-rule-super := add-only-no-ccont-rule &
        [ INFLECTED [ COPULA-NPST-PERNUM-MARKER-FLAG +,
            ...
        ].

Before this change, we see two generations for sentence 15-17, one of them
having no ending on the verb:
    khlea-mim dzɵpa  bu
    dog-pl    hungry be
    Dogs be hungry.
After this change, we gladly see only one generation:
    khlea-mim dzɵpa  bu-mi
    dog-pl    hungry be-3pl
    Dogs are hungry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sources of residual ambiguity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our sources of ambiguity are:

(1) split ergative/nominative case for transitive agents. We have our case specified as NOM+ERG, which means that we generate examples where the agent may be marked with either nominative or ergative case marking.

(2) Polite/plain forms of the 2nd and 3rd singular personal pronouns. This is a feature of tdh, so we cannot remove it.

(3) Regarding sje -> tdh sentence 4:
We get two outputs, with different MRSes but we cannot figure out why this should work
 (a) Khlea-mim-lai pe-mi -> UNEXPECTED (transitive form of verb pe, to eat X)
 (b) Khlea-mim pe-mi -> EXPECTED (intransitive form of verb pe, to eat). 
The MRS of (a) roughly translates to 'X eats the dogs'. (b) is the 'the dogs eat'. How then is this possible? We could have avoided this by simply removing the transitive form of eat from our lexicon but (a) and (b) signal something is awry somewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MMT coverage for sje and eng
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following sentences successfully produce output generation from 
(source) -> (target)
eng -> tdh (1) (2*) (3*) (4) (5*) (8*) (9*) (15) (16) (17) (19)
sje -> tdh (1) (2*) (3*) (4*) (5*) (8*) (9*) (19)
* represents sentences that have residual ambiguity/multiple generation outputs.

Regarding sentence 10 (coordination over VPs): we are working on the transfer rule for this complex construction but haven't completed it yet.
Our descriptive materials do not provide prose of coordination over VPs and this sentence involves coordinating intransitive and transitive verbs. In Thulung, case constraints differ for the agent/subject of these two verb classes. As discussed in class, this requires us to write a transfer rule such that one of the verbs is treated as having a pro-dropped subject. The semantics would would be something like [cats chase dogs and (something) sleeps] where the "something" pragmatically refers to cat.
