Lab 9 to-do

1. 10 sentences where eng -> tdh generates
2. 7 sentences where sje -> tdh generates
3. Investigate if we need transfer rules
4. Need to ask emily what to do about S vs VP Coordination
see sentences 9 and 10 -> 10 is supposed to use VP coordination
5. eng -> tdh #8 our coordination strategy does not pass up pernum features because we don't know what the pernum of conjunctions looks like in Thulung
is 3pl and 3pl -> 3pl? Or is it something else?


           (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (8) (9) (10) (15) (16) (17) (19)
eng -> tdh (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (--) (--)
sje -> tdh (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y)
tdh -> eng (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (n) (--)
tdh -> sje (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y)


TO-DO
1. Trigger rules for semantically empty copulas
2. Transfer rules
 -- locative _in_p_rel transfer rules
 -- *TRY* VP coordination transfer rule for intransitive and monotransitive coordination using prodrop


 Friday sync
 - verb endings for 15&17 -> getting bu along with bu_mi
 - 16 some issue related to _in_p_rel


 tried 
 #25 -> khlea-mim ʌms-mi mala subupo-mim ʌms-mi 
 but mala is "if then"
 it does show we have some sort of support for adverbial clause modifiers but would need more work to add because/after


 need to add constraint where copula tense and affix tense must match
 - go ba-ŋu ma ʌms-ŋu should not work but it does
